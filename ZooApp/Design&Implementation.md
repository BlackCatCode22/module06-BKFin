# Design & Implementation

## Design

- Create Animal.java file

  - Have to create Animal super class
  - Getters & Setters
  - Subclasses
    - Unique attribute per subclass
    - Setters and getters for the subclasses

- Create Main.java
  - Need to create an array of animal objects
  - Need to keep track of the number of different animals
  - Use File IO to read in txt files and use the data to create animal objects
  - Output the manipulated data into a report text file called newAnimals.txt

## Implementation

- Created the Animal.java file

  - Created Animal superclass with species, name, and age attributes
  - Created Setters & Getters
  - Created Subclasses for Hyena, Bear, Lion & Tiger
    - Created a unique attribute for each subclass
    - Created setters & getters for the subclass attributes

- Created Main.java
  - Used ArrayList to hold an array of objects built off the Animal superclass
  - Used a HashMap to hold the number of each type of species
  - Used the Scanner and BufferedWriters classes to read input files and output request report file

**Make sure to Comment Code!**

## Code Review

- Refactored the code iterating through the animals objects so it was one loop with if/then statements.

## Experiment

- I tried replacing the if/then statements with a switch statement, but couldn't figure out how to use strings.
